  "description": "This extension makes XKB shortcuts to switch keyboard layouts (such as Caps Lock, Ctrl+Shift, etc.) cycle between the two first layouts. The other ones still can be selected via the menu or using GNOME's shortcuts (Super+Space, Shift+Super+Space). It's useful when you have two primary layouts and more additional, which are used more rarely.",
